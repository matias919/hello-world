                On February 1, 1959, nine ski-hikers went to the Ural                     mountains, what is now Russia. The group set up a camp on                 the slope of Kholat 
                Syakhl, that is now named Igor Dyatlov, the name of the                   groups leader. Something mysterious had happenad to them, 
                because they never returned.<br><br>Serchers were sent to
                find the missing group. After many days of searching, on 
                February 26, searchers found the ski-hiker's abandoned 
                camp sight, where their tent was <em>ripped open from the
                inside.</em> Footprints were found, that led to the near
                by woods, where the first two bodies were found, with
                only underwear on. The other seven bodies were found later.               First they were thought to have died from hypothermia, but
                when the bodies were inventoried by medical examiners, the
                evidence made no sense. Some of the bodies had radioactive
                clothes on and some had signs of physical trauma, one body
                had third-degree burns, one was missing a tongue, and 
                another was missing both eyes. One body had a fractured
                skull and another had been vomiting blood.<br><br> There are many 
                theories of this mystery. One of them is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"                       >infrasound</a>
                , wich is a real phenomenon, that can cause fear in humans. It's still unknown what happened that night to the nine ski-hikers.

       <div class="ghost-train zanetti"> <h2 class="japan"> The Zanetti Ghost Train</h2>
           <p >
               On july 14, 1911 a railway company "Zanetti" offered some Italians a free trial ride on their new train from Rome to Modena. It was a three-car train with  106 Italians on it. One afternoon it left from Rome. The passengers were enjoying the ride and watching at the beautiful landscapes. On the ride they would go through a recently built tunnel, that was one of the longest built at the time. But when the train went in to the tunnel, it never came out on the other side. Every square inch of the new tunnel was searched, but nothing was found. Somehow two passengers managed to escape the train to tell their story. They told that a thick white fog apeared in the tunnel swallowing the whole train. One of the survivors told that he heard a unclear humming sound and the other had sleeping problems after the incident. During the second world war the tunnel was bombed, closing it for ever.
               
               <br><br> No one could explain what happened to the Zanetti train, but in the 1840s in Mexico 104 Italians arrived in a hysterical condition at a local hospital. They claimed that they were coming from a train ride from Rome to Modena. But that's not the only sighting of the ghost train. During the medieval time period in europe the monks wrote about a  large moving steel machine with three cars and passengers on it with black clothes on. The fastest transport of the time was by horse. Did the medieval monks really see a train or did they make the whole thing up.<br><br> Some theories suggest that all the world's railways make a connected web with it's own magnetic field and the trains serve as electric conductors between the Earths magnetic field and the artificial magnetic field. This conflict creates fractures in time, creating endless holes. These conflicts are called chronal holes. Before the Zanetti train left the station, there had been a earthquake under the tunnel. It's believed to have created a time anomaly in the entrance of the tunnel and the train was able to travel in time.
               The story of Zanetti ghost train is just a urban legend and you don't need to worry about getting lost in a ghost train.

           <h1 class="japan mystery">The missing town of Urkhammer</h1>
           <p class="japan">Urkhammer was a small town in Iowa. It was                  like any other small town, with buildings poping up now and then, the grass trimmed and maintained roads. But on one day in 1929 it vanished with it's citizens. It was seen first from the planes that flew over it. The pilots claimed that they saw over grown fields and abandoned buildings. It's unknown when Urkhammer was established or did it ever even exist. Reports kept coming of the missing town.<br>
           Some people claimed that they saw the town evaporating in to thin air and a driver who filled his tank there said that he realized that his tank wasn't filled and he drove back to Urkhammer. But the town was nowhere to be seen.<br>The story of the missing town of Urkhammer was forgotten after the stock market crash of 1929 happened, the start of the great depression.
